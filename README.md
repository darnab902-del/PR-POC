### API Endpoints

#### Upload Files

Content-Type: multipart/form-data

files[]: File data

## Security Considerations

1. **File Validation**: All uploaded files are validated for type and content
2. **Secure Storage**: Files are renamed to prevent conflicts and security issues
3. **Access Control**: Downloads are handled through a secure script
4. **Content Scanning**: Basic malicious content detection is implemented
5. **Logging**: All activities are logged for security monitoring

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- GD extension (for image thumbnails)
- Write permissions for upload directory
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)

## Customization

### Styling
Edit the CSS in `index.html` and `manage.php` to customize the appearance.

### File Processing
Modify `upload.php` to add custom file processing logic.

### Storage Backend
Replace the JSON file storage with a database by implementing custom storage functions.

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails
1. Check file size limits in both `config.php` and `php.ini`
2. Verify write permissions on upload directory
3. Check error logs in the `logs/` directory

### Files Not Displaying
1. Ensure `upload_log.json` exists and is readable
2. Check file permissions
3. Verify JSON format is valid

### Thumbnails Not Generated
1. Ensure GD extension is installed
2. Check write permissions on `uploads/thumbnails/` directory
3. Verify image files are valid
